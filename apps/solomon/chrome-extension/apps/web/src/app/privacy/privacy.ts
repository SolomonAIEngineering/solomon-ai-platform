# Privacy Policy for AnyContext

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy provides detailed information on the handling, storage, and protection of your personal information by AnyContext, a browser extension developed and owned by Dhravya Shah in 2024. The extension is designed to enhance your browsing experience by providing contextual information based on the content of the web pages you visit. This policy outlines the types of data collected by AnyContext, how it is used, and the measures we take to protect your privacy.

## Information Collection

AnyContext collects the following types of information:

1. **Web Browsing Data**: The extension has the capability to see all websites that users visit. However, AnyContext only stores data when the user actively clicks on the extension button while browsing. The browser history is not recorded, ensuring that your browsing activities remain private.

2. **Current Page Data**: Upon activation (click) by the user, AnyContext stores data from the current HTML page. This data is used to provide relevant contextual information based on the content of the page you are viewing.

3. **Personal Information**: When you interact with AnyContext, we may collect personal information including but not limited to your email address, session data, name, and profile picture. This information is collected to improve your user experience and to provide personalized services.

## Data Storage and Security

All collected data is securely stored in a SQLite database hosted on Cloudflare D1. We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Use of Information

AnyContext uses the collected information for the following purposes:

- To provide and improve the functionality of the extension.
- To offer personalized user experiences.
- To communicate with users regarding updates, support, and promotional offers, if consented.
- To ensure the security of our services and to detect, prevent, or address technical issues.

## Sharing of Information

AnyContext does not sell, trade, or rent users' personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
